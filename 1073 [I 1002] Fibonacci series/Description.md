# [I 1002] Fibonacci series

# Description

The Fibonacci series  
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …
```
beginning with 0 and 1 has the property that each succeeding term is the sum of the two preceding terms.  
For an input positive integer m (m>=2), verify if m is a term of the Fibonacci series. If yes, i.e. m equals to the nth Fibonacci number, print out the term position n. Else (m is not a term of the Fibonacci series), print out 0.
# Input
First line is an integer T, indicates the number of test cases.   
The 2nd line to the (T+1)th line, each line is an positive integer m (m >= 2)
# Output
Output in a line for each test case. The number of the term if the input is a term of the Fibonacci series, 0 if it is not.
